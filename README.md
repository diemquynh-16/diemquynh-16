# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Diem Quynh. I'm a Data Science student interested in Data Analytics and Data Engineering.

This GitHub is where I:
- Practice programming and problem solving
- Build academic and personal projects
- Document my learning journey

Currently working with C/C++, Python, R, and SQL.

Still learning, still improving.
